Hi there 👋 Welcome to my GitHub Profile!

I am an aspiring cybersecurity professional with an interest in digital forensics. I have been studying Cybersecurity since 2018 during my Level 3 where I achieved Distinction. After that in 2019 me alongside a team-mate won the WorldSkills Cybersecurity 2019 National Competition. During my spare time I usually study different courses on Udemy or LinkedIn Learning to expand my knowledge and hoping to pursue a few certifications over the summer such as Cisco CyberOps Associate and CompTIA CySA+.

- 🔭 I’m currently working on my degree (Cyber Security and Forensics Computing), Cisco CyberOps Associates, CompTIA CySA+
-
- 🌱 I’m always open to learn new things, especially anything that has to do with Cybersecurity, right now I am working through 2 GoLang books (1 to learn GoLang and another one about BlackHat GoLang)
